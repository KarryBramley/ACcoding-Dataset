### ACcoding: A graph-based dataset for online judge programming

### Dataset

The dataset, named ACcoding, was built by a university teaching group.  The latest release of ACcoding dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/6522395. By the time of constructing the dataset (May 6, 2022), the dataset contains 4,046,652 task-solving records submitted by 27,444 students on 4,559 programming tasks over a span of 6 years. The large size of the dataset, combined with its rich functional features, empowers educators to trace studentsâ€™programming progress and choose appropriate programming tasks for specific training purposes. 

### Load Dataset

You can download the ACcoding dataset from https://zenodo.org/record/6522395, which includes 6 SQL files. Assuming that you have already created a MySQL database, you can load the data files by executing the command 

```bash
source xxx.sql
```

 in MySQL. Alternatively, you can use tools like Navicat or DataGrip to load the SQL files. 

### Data Format

ACcoding dataset is constructed and stored in a relational database in the form of tables. Note that in the table below, names in lower cases are entities, and those in upper cases are relations between the entities.
